# Ecommerce-fraud-detection-analysis
A project to detect overcharged, undercharged charges/fee and detecting fraud 
When assigning primary keys to table i had to remove the duplicates at same in the tables where duplicates are present in the table
in the eda analysis since we werent given order volume i had to make use of the weight to do the volume analysis
when rounding up the weight to nearest 0.5kg the safe mode was hindering me therefore i toggled it off then brought it back on
